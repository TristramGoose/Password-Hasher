# Password-Hasher
Java password hashing and authentication package. Supports hashing algorithms like:  
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512

Project is currently in development
Javadoc documentation comming soon
All I can say about current reliability is that it has worked properly with proper input so far 
and I hope to have some more rigourous tests made up within the week.

Contributions: This is a personal project of mine that I am doing to learn the process of safely storing passwords.
contributions are welcome just be prepaired for me to pick your brain on what you want to change/add in my quest for knowledge!

Rules:
  -Try to keep your programming style similar to that which is already being used.
  -Every time I see a variable name start with a $dollar sign I die inside a little. Please avoid!
  -Keep conversations civil and about programming. Please no profanity.
